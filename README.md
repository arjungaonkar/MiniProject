>insert into SKINPURCHASED(Username) values(%s)

4.**Delete account**
>delete from PLAYER where Username=%s

5.**Update selected skin**
>update PLAYER set SkinIDuse=%s where Username=%s and exists (select SkinID from SKINPURCHASED where SkinID=%s)

6.**Buy skin**,subtract the credit,if credit<0 then add the credit back and display no credit
>update PLAYER set credit=credit-(select price from SKIN where SkinID=%s) where username='%s' and credit-(select price from skin where skinid=%s)>=0

>insert into SKINPURCHASED values('%s',%s)

>if failure,update PLAYER set credit=credit+(select price from SKIN where SkinID=%s) where username='%s'

7.**Update score**
>update PLAYER set Score=Score+100,Credit=Credit+10 where Username='%s'

8.**Update gamestat**
>insert into GAMESTAT(Player1,Player2,Duration) values('%s','%s',%d)
>update GAMESTAT set winner='%s',Duration=Duration-%d where (player1='%s' or player2='%s') and winner is null
